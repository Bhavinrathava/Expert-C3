For instance, if economists conclude microcredit is effective at alleviating poverty based on observed data, policymakers might decide to distribute microcredit in other locations or future years. Typically, the original data is not a perfect random sample from the population where policy is applied -- but researchers might feel comfortable generalizing anyway so long as deviations from random sampling are small, and the corresponding impact on conclusions is small as well. Conversely, researchers might worry if a very small proportion of the data sample was instrumental to the original conclusion. So we propose a method to assess the sensitivity of statistical conclusions to the removal of a very small fraction of the data set. Manually checking all small data subsets is computationally infeasible, so we propose an approximation based on the classical influence function. Our method is automatically computable for common estimators. We provide finite-sample error bounds on approximation performance and a low-cost exact lower bound on sensitivity. We find that sensitivity is driven by a signal-to-noise ratio in the inference problem, does not disappear asymptotically, and is not decided by misspecification. Empirically we find that many data analyses are robust, but the conclusions of several influential economics papers can be changed by removing (much) less than 1% of the data.\r\n&#160;","description_html":"<p><strong>An Automatic Finite-Sample Robustness Check: Can Dropping a Little Data Change Conclusions?<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>Tamara Broderick, Associate Professor, Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at MIT<\/p>\r\n<p>Abstract: Practitioners will often analyze a data sample with the goal of applying any conclusions to a new population.

Would the tape have a different story in every replay? Or is there a general order of events? The relevance of this thought experiment is not just philosophical or counterfactual, because (re)assembly processes undergone by ecological systems, from microbes to mega-fauna, are continuously replicating the experiment. By integrating theoretical and empirical work, in this talk I will provide a guideline to increase our understanding about the (re)assembly possibilities of ecological systems. Explaining and predicting the (re)assembly of ecological systems underpins our ability to develop successful interventions in bio-restoration, bio-technologies, and bio-medicine.\r\nSpeaker Bio:\r\nSerguei Saavedra is an Associate Professor at MIT in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering. He is also an external faculty at Santa Fe Institute. Serguei is a theoretical ecologist focused on understanding the feasibility of observing the emergence, transformations, and regeneration of ecological systems under environmental changes. Before joining MIT in 2016, Serguei studied systems engineering in Mexico; specialized in mathematical modeling at Genoa University; completed his PhD in engineering science at Oxford University; and did his postdoctoral work at the NICO (under the mentorship of Brian Uzzi), Do&#241;ana Biological Station, and in the department of environmental systems at ETH.\r\nLocation:\r\nIn person: Chambers Hall, 600 Foster Street, Lower Level\nRemote option: https:\/\/northwestern.zoom.us\/j\/91082510906\nPasscode: NICO2024\r\nAbout the Speaker Series:\r\nWednesdays@NICO is a vibrant weekly seminar series focusing broadly on the topics of complex systems, data science and network science.

The relevance of this thought experiment is not just philosophical or counterfactual, because (re)assembly processes undergone by ecological systems, from microbes to mega-fauna, are continuously replicating the experiment. By integrating theoretical and empirical work, in this talk I will provide a guideline to increase our understanding about the (re)assembly possibilities of ecological systems. Explaining and predicting the (re)assembly of ecological systems underpins our ability to develop successful interventions in bio-restoration, bio-technologies, and bio-medicine.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Speaker Bio:<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/cee.mit.edu\/people_individual\/serguei-saavedra\/\">Serguei Saavedra<\/a> is an Associate Professor at MIT in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering. He is also an external faculty at Santa Fe Institute. Serguei is a theoretical ecologist focused on understanding the feasibility of observing the emergence, transformations, and regeneration of ecological systems under environmental changes. Before joining MIT in 2016, Serguei studied systems engineering in Mexico; specialized in mathematical modeling at Genoa University; completed his PhD in engineering science at Oxford University; and did his postdoctoral work at the NICO (under the mentorship of Brian Uzzi), Do&#241;ana Biological Station, and in the department of environmental systems at ETH.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Location:<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>In person: Chambers Hall, 600 Foster Street, Lower Level<br \/>Remote option: <a href=\"https:\/\/northwestern.zoom.us\/j\/91082510906?pwd=Y2VTZ0VpdDNZOWpiRnBVckhtTUl2UT09\">https:\/\/northwestern.zoom.us\/j\/91082510906<\/a><br \/>Passcode: NICO2024<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>About the Speaker Series:<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>Wednesdays@NICO is a vibrant weekly seminar series focusing broadly on the topics of complex systems, data science and network science.
